# RFC-0501 ![GitHub issue detail](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/detail/state/jilleJr/gh-pages-test/0?logo=github&style=for-the-badge)

- Feature name: `fix-the-thing`
- Author: Kalle
- Implementation: <https://github.com/jilleJr/gh-pages-test/issues/0>

## Summary

It's important when doing things to also fix the things. There's this big thing that needs fixing. Fix the thing

## Motivation

No one likes an unfixed thing. Thing needs fix

## Explanation

Fix by doing this:

> ``(?:[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\.[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*|"(?:[\x01-\x08\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x1f\x21\x23-\x5b\x5d-\x7f]|\\[\x01-\x09\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x7f])*")@(?:(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?|\[(?:(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.){3}(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?|[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]:(?:[\x01-\x08\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x1f\x21-\x5a\x53-\x7f]|\\[\x01-\x09\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x7f])+)\])``

That'll solve everything. I promise, I checked.

## Compatability

With this fixed, other unfixed things such as thing01 will stop working. But that's their fault for not fixing that thing.

## Drawbacks

Less things to fix once this thing is fixed

## Alternatives

Just the following would also fix the thing, probably, but it's less cool:

> `.+@.+`

## Unresolved questions

None

## Future possibilities

This fixed thing lays the ground for that other thing we need to fix later. It's so crucial in fact, that that unfixed thing cannot do its thing without this thing fix.
